Whatâ€™s Included

1. Reports:

A detailed report of all the testing performed, including methodologies, vulnerabilities found, and recommendations.



2. Video Demonstration:

A video walkthrough of the attacks conducted on the Juice Shop.



3. Scripts and Logs:

Commands and scripts used during testing.

Output logs from tools like Dirb and Burp Suite.



4. Screenshots:

Proof of findings, including discovered admin paths and successful exploits.
